#Code project of Developing Data Products

##Introduction

This repository is created for the final project of the 'Developing Data Products' Coursera course. The repository consists of three final project submission files:


ui.R 
server.R 
README.md 


The ui.R and server.R are the code I have written for the final project shiny application named Iris Species Prediction. Following are the final project submission links of my iris species prediction shiny application and RStudio presentation slides:


The shiny application is deployed on ShinyApps.io server at: https://fooway.shinyapps.io/Cousera_Developing_Data_Products  
The RStudio presentation slides is published to RPubs at: http://rpubs.com/Fooway/devdataproducts

If you like to run my Iris Species Prediction shiny application locally on your installed RStudio, you need to:


1)Clone the code of this repository using 'git clone https://github.com/Fooway/Developing_Data_Products.git YOURDIRECTORY'
2)Start your RStudio
3)Set your working directory to YOURDIRECTORY using setwd("YOURDIRECTORY")
4)Install and load the shiny package using first install.packages("shiny") then library(shiny)
5)Run the application using runApp()
6)The Iris Species Predictor shiny application will appear in a browser. To get help on how to use the application, please read the Notes on the page.
